tasknc - a ncurses wrapper around taskwarrior
    by mjheagle

key binds:
    j/k/arrowkeys: navigation up and down
    home: go to first task
    end: go to last task
    e: edit selected task
    r: reload task list
    u: run task undo
    d: delete selected task
    c: mark selected task as complete
    a/n: create a new task
    v/enter: run task info on selected task
    s: resort list (prompted for sort algorithm)
    y: synchronize (run task merge and task push)
    q: exit tasknc
